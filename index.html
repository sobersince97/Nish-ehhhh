                    <p> I basically had no idea that the Starbucks cooffee (19th eve) would go this good to me and would enrich me in a feel where I am today. 
                    My sudden plan to come to Anand and you being in Anand was like the cheery on the top I must say. That Hotel H ice-cream together with your bestie 
Kishan was some another kind of an adventure. Later the night, things turned us both, lol not to mention the good things hahahaha. THe incident when we were caught by the police is still fresh 
in front of my eyes. Followed that the fight u witnessed of my friends! Memorable I guess! The question aditya asked you about the bike ride and drop service is worthy of remembering!
Followed that MOM'S , cancell of plan because of somebody's xyz reason is still a point to fight on! hahaha ! Lastly, your sadness which i assumed was because you didnt want
to drop me but later realised the reason was because we were going apart ! Tushar bhai at Vasad lol ! Ur dongiri ! Everything is purely insane!

                    <p>Bharuch station, train going before my eye, i hope you remember it all! 7th November morning came with different colours where 
                the person with whom I was going told me to call him  when I reach. My call was ignored as always. Specials ones landed at 8.30-8.45 but cant wait at the 
room door for 5 minutes. The day was supendous with butterflies all over. The breakfast and the search of a shop where someone was again shy lol ! The lunch at Gokul.
And the noticing  of people not by moving the actual eye is the talent I learned! lol! The night where because of someone's sleep and tantrums we couldnt find a place
in a single club! Finally after much of a thing Mocking Bird came as a rescue!
